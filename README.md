clj-atn
=======

Clojure code to parse Photoshop action files

Example 1:

clj-atn.core=> (read-atn "Fragment.atn")
{:actions ({:nr-action-events 1, :expanded 1, :name "Action 1", :color-index 0, :command-key 0, :shift-key 0, :index 0}), :nr-actions 1, :expanded 1, :set-name "Fragment", :version 16, :filename "Fragment.atn"}

Example 2:

clj-atn.core=> (write-json (read-atn "Fragment.atn") "/tmp/Fragment.json")

Writes the following file contents:

    {
        actions: [
            {
                nr-action-events: 1,
                expanded: 1,
                name: "Action 1",
                color-index: 0,
                command-key: 0,
                shift-key: 0,
                index: 0
            }
        ],
        nr-actions: 1,
        expanded: 1,
        set-name: "Fragment",
        version: 16,
        filename: "Fragment.atn"
    }
